# CL_Habits
Just a simple CLI habit tracker

## New Idea
What if I just had a really crappy nebulous system that was super chaotic and ADHD filled. 

I think you should basically just be able to throw anything at it and it catches it. 

Just update and or enter statuses for whatever and if it doesn't exist it will just make a new track. 

The todo list can be cleared, and things can optionally have due dates.
